# INTERNSHIP TASK

## Purpose of the task - Creation of software allowing for:
* listing repositories(the name and number of stars)
* returning sum of stars from all repositories
for any user of the GitHub service

Data should be returned using the http protocol

## Technologies
Python 3.8 with libraries such as:
* requests
* json
* operator
* collections

Requests isn't a built-in module so we have to use the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install requests
```

If we want to use the application, just run it in the terminal

# Additional features:
Apart from listing the list of repositories and counting the number of stars, the application counts the technologies / languages used in each repository and determines in which user technology it creates the most projects. The application also retrieves information about the size of each repository and can determine which repository takes up the most space
